## Outline

- **Introduction [10 minutes]**
  - Provide an overview of what will be covered in the tutorial.
  - Ensure everyone is set up with tutorial materials.

- **An overview of Dask [30 minutes]**
  - Review Daskâ€™s delayed, array, and DataFrame interfaces.
  - Recap the components of Daskâ€™s distributed scheduler.
  - Participants will recap the basics of how to use the high-level Dask interfaces to accomplish well supported tasks and parallelize custom algorithms.

*10 minute break*

- **Advanced Dask Collections [50 minutes]**
  - Discuss applying custom operations on Dask arrays and DataFrames.
  - Discuss Daskâ€™s graph optimization system.
  - Review the Dask collection interface and implement our own custom collection.

*10 minute break*

- **Hacking the distributed scheduler [50 minutes]**
  - Highlight built in coordination primitives like `Lock`s, `Event`s, and `Semaphore`s.
  - Demonstrate how to customize worker and scheduler behavior using Daskâ€™s plugin system.
  - Learn how to inspect the internal state of a clusterâ€™s scheduler and workers.
  - Participants will gain a better understanding of Dask internals and how to troubleshoot common pitfalls of distributed computing.
